description: Over the past 5 years, I've embarked on an incredible journey through the realm of data science. It's been an adventure filled with challenges, learning, and the chance to make a real impact. Earning my Masterâ€™s degree in Data Science from UB SUNY opened my eyes to the incredible new ways data can be used to improve our world, from enhancing urban life to clearing the air we breathe. My toolbox is packed with skills like Python, SQL, AWS, Tableau, and machine learning algorithms, but I've learned that the real magic happens when you blend those technical skills with teamwork, leadership, and the ability to connect with people. I'm passionate about making a positive mark on the planet, constantly feeding my curiosity with thought provoking books, and always on the lookout for the next tech innovation. I firmly believe in the power of data to transform our world for the better, and I'm always excited to meet fellow travelers on this path.
